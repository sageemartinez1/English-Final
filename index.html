                                    <p>The Sage experience has been a fun ride. I've been at Sage since 7th grade. I have truly enjoyed my 6 years here. Since the beginning, the staff have been my favorite part of Sage, I don't think anywhere else would
                                        have helped me realize my strengths. Before Sage I wasn't really involved with school. I somehow managed to find my way into everything that takes place and help out however I can. Without the staff It wouldn't
                                        have been possible.</p>
                                    <p> The students have always been another beast of its own but I was always able to handle myself well when it came to them, Always stayed friendly with my peers no matter what and that came to my favor as i've been lucky
                                        to never be the cause of drama, which unfortunately is what lot of others have to go through. I absolutely love sage and how much it's helped me. The only times I regretted being at sage, was when I felt as if I'd
                                        be better off socially at district.</p>

                                    <p>The 10 Year paper was one of the first essays I completed during my freshman year. I talked about what I imagined life would be like in 10 years, what schooling I'd be interested in attending, Where I wanted to live,
                                        and other things of the sort. I'm happy this piece exists, as I'm able to now look back on it and realize how much has changed.</p>

                                    <p>The Augmented reality paper was a good chance for me to finally do a research paper on something I'm interested in. Working on this, allowed me to improve greatly on filtering through information when researching. This
                                        is a skill I'm grateful for, not only is it insanely useful for school work, but the real world too.

                                    <p>The DIY Fan project is one of my all time favorites. It looks simple but I had to learn a lot to get it working. This project required learning how to solder,wiring,and some general electrical knowledge. I looked forward
                                        to working on this project everyday, and it showed I could focus and commit to something.</p>

                                <p>I think everyone could attest to the fact that living through the covid epidemic was not easy. Myself and many others had a hard time adjusting to the new reality. Having school randomly changed to online and not being
                                    able to leave the house, was something to get used to. When I had to log onto my classes, I opted to sleep instead as there was nothing to hold me accountable. Not only was I struggling to attend classes, I somehow
                                    managed to get really sick on multiple occasions while quarantined. The first time I developed bronchitis, followed by a form of tuberculosis. When school became in-person again, it felt like I had to relearn something
                                    that I should have been accustomed to, so that was stressful in itself. </p>

                                <p>Sophomore year I started working part time at a dog groomer. I love dogs so it was a very enjoyable job no matter how tiring it was. I learned alot from this experience, not only about dogs but how to deal with coworkers
                                    and problem solving. I truly wasn't prepared for how fast the time passed when I got absorbed into work. It was genuinely such a rewarding experience to be able to do my job, and do it right. That experience will definitely
                                    help me for my next job.</p>
